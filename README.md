**An AI-powered voice assistant built on the Inya.ai platform to automate and streamline the admissions inquiry process for educational institutions.**

This project features a specialized conversational agent, named **Pranali**, designed to handle a wide range of admissions-related queries, provide information on courses and fees, and intelligently schedule meetings with the admissions team.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Intelligent Inquiry Handling:** Answers common questions about courses (JEE, NEET, CET), fees, and the institution's track record.
- **24/7 Availability:** Provides constant support to prospective students and parents, ensuring no inquiry is missed.
- **Automated Meeting Scheduler:** Integrates directly with a **Google Calendar** to check team availability and book one-on-one meetings.
- **Persona-Driven Interactions:** Maintained a friendly and approachable tone to create a positive user experience.
- **Robust Integrations:** Configurable with services like **Twilio** for SMS notifications and tracking call outcomes with **Disposition** analytics.

## üöÄ How It Works

The agent follows a seamless, end-to-end call flow:

1.  A user initiates a call to the admissions line.
2.  The agent greets the user and answers their questions based on its knowledge base.
3.  If the user is interested, the agent offers to book a one-on-one meeting with the admissions team.
4.  The agent checks for an available time slot and, upon confirmation, books the meeting in a shared Google Calendar.
